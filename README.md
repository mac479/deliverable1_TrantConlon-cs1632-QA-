# CS 1632 - Software Testing
Spring Semester 2020

* DUE: February 7, 2020 11:59 PM

## Deliverable 1

For this assignment, your group will determine a test plan for the simple game Coffee Maker Quest, based on the requirements listed.  There are several known defects in the software; you will need to find and report on at least three.  Additionally, a traceability matrix showing the mapping of test cases to requirements is required.

If you still haven't found a partner, please post on the courseweb discussion board.  There should be two and only two members of a group.

There should be at least as many test cases as requirements, although I would normally expect several test cases per requirement.  As a general rule, I'd estimate that the number of test cases is at least 2x the number of requirements.  If the number of test cases is more than 3x the number of requirements, you are probably overtesting.

Each requirement should have AT LEAST one test case associated with it, and each test case should have EXACTLY ONE requirement associated with it.  This can easily be checked via a traceability matrix (which you should also deliver).  In a real world scenario, one test case can test multiple requirements but, for the purposes of this assignment, please limit it to one requirement (the one that is tested primarily).

Test cases should mention all necessary preconditions, execution steps, and postconditions.

It is NOT necessary to make multiple test plans inside a test suite; it is enough for there to be one test plan.

I expect you to test several edge cases (boundary values) as part of the test plan.

It is expected that you actually execute the test plan in order to find the defects.  There are AT LEAST three.  Full credit will be given only to those who properly find and describe at least three.  While you are not expected to find all of the defects, a reasonable test plan should definitely find at least three.  This is an intentionally target-rich environment.

## Format
The report should start with a cover page with:
* The name of the project under test
* The names of the people in the group
* The title "CS 1632 - DELIVERABLE 1: Test Plan and Traceability Matrix"

There should be a short introduction (a few paragraphs) in which you may note any concerns or difficulties you may have had or anticipate with the testing process.  You should also note why you considered certain test cases, how you came up with edge cases, etc.

ON A NEW PAGE, a traceability matrix should be provided mapping the test cases with their associated requirements.  Remember that all requirements should map to AT LEAST ONE test case, and all test cases should map to EXACTLY ONE requirement.  

ON A NEW PAGE, a list of the actual test cases should follow.  You may name or number them any way you wish, but be consistent.  You may wish to write them out in this format -

	IDENTIFIER:
	TEST CASE: 
	PRECONDITIONS:
	EXECUTION STEPS:
	POSTCONDITIONS:

ON A NEW PAGE, list at least three defects found.  The defects should follow the defect reporting template:

	 IDENTIFIER:
	 SUMMARY:
	 DESCRIPTION:
	 REPRODUCTION STEPS:
	 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
	 OBSERVED BEHAVIOR:

Other attributes of a defect (e.g., SEVERITY or IMPACT) are not necessary.  The test case which found the defect should be listed as part of the DESCRIPTION.

## Grading
* Introduction: 10% of grade
* Test Plan: 40% of grade
* Traceability Matrix: 20% of grade
* Defects Found and Described: 30% of grade

Please review the grading_rubric.txt for details.

## Coffee Maker Quest
Coffee Maker Quest is a simple game.  The goal is get coffee, sugar, and cream, and then drink it so that you can stay up and study.  In order to do so, you need to visit several rooms in a house and look around.  Once you have obtained all the necessary elements, you win.  If you decide to drink before getting all of the necessary elements, you lose.

You can run it downloading the coffeemaker.jar file and running:
```bash
java -jar coffeemaker.jar
```

The requirements are listed in the file requirements.txt.

## Submission

Please use the ReportTemplate.docx file provided in this directory to write your report.  If you don't have a .docx compatible word processor, that's perfectly fine as long as you follow the same organization.  A PDF version of the file is at ReportTemplate.pdf.  Please make sure that the intro, traceability matrix, test cases, and defects are on seperate pages.  You will be submitting to GradeScope in PDF format.  When you submit, you will be asked to assign pages in the PDF file to each rubric item: 1. Introduction, 2. Traceability Matrix, 3. Test Cases, and 4. Defects.

Each pairwise group will submit the exercise *once* to GradeScope, by *one member* of the group.  The submitting member will press the "View or edit group" link at the top-right corner of the assignment page after submission to add his/her partner.  Make sure that your partner is there, or he/she will not get a grade.

Please feel free to email me at wahn@pitt.edu or come to office hours to discuss any problems you have.
